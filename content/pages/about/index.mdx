Hello 👋!

My name is Min Ho Lim, a former film director/maker 📽️ turned into a software engineer 👨‍💻️.
I love programming in general especially working on fron-end 🌐, but don't get me wrong that I do love back-end 💻 as much as I love front-end!

If you want to learn more about me check out [my website](https://minholim.com) or explore my blog ❤️ !
